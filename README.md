# clockGame

Clock game was made at a hackathon for a non-profit organization called <a href="http://villagetechsolutions.org/Education.html">VillageTech Solutions<a> (VTS). VTS is developing a learning tool called Looma, "an affordable and low power consuming audio-visual technology device which will provide an interactive window to the internet and access to educational content to village schools that have never seen electricity, computers, or in some cases, even books."

My team decided that we needed to make something simple, yet invaluable - a way to teach children how to tell time. There are two versions of the game: the singleClock version is normal time telling, and the doubleClock version is where the user inputs the difference between two times.


We haven't worked out all the kinks yet, so there are a few minor bugs that we plan on fixing soon.
